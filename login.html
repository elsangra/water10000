                    Kenya Kwanza government is guided by key policy documents which include the 2010 Constitution of Kenya,the Kenya Kwanza Manifesto, Vision 2030, Sustainable Development Goals, AU Agenda 2063, and other international development frameworks and conventions.The
                    Constitution of Kenya 2010 recognizes universal access to safe, clean, adequate water supply and sanitation as a basic human right. The UN Millennium Declaration has set a target to halve the proportion of people living without access
                    to clean drinking water and basic sanitation. Kenya's government has committed itself to ensure the achievement of SDG 6 on universal access to water and sanitation for all by 2030. The National Water Master Plan 2030 estimates water
                    demand to rise from 3.2 billion cubic meters per annum (2010) to 12.5 billion cubic meters per annum by 2030. Water coverage increased from 57% in 2019/20 to 60% in 2020/21 mainly as a result of the population served increasing at
                    a higher rate compared to the population within the area of service, urban sewerage coverage increased from 15% to 16% mainly in 35 urban canters spread across 23 counties while overall sanitation coverage increased from 88% to 93%
                    during the same period according to WASREB impact 14 report-2022. With the ambition of 100% universal access by the year 2030 fast approaching, huge investments need to be made to improve the current situation.</p>

                    The mandate of the Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and Irrigation is to ensure every person has the right to access clean and safe water in adequate quantity, reasonable standards of sanitation and free from hunger, and adequate food of acceptable quality
                    to support the development of the country. This is anchored in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution in article 43 (d) which states that every person has the right to clean and safe water in adequate quantities,43(b) the right to
                    reasonable standards of sanitation, and 43 (c) to be free from hunger and to have adequate food of acceptable quality. To progressively realize access to clean and safe water in adequate quantities, provision of reasonable standards
                    of sanitation,and attainment of food security, the Ministry is implementing reforms in the Water Sector that align the institutional arrangements and its operations to the CoK 2010 and the Water Act 2016 and Irrigation Act 2019. The
                    ultimate goal of the Sector is therefore to achieve Kenya Vision 2030, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No 6, Ngor Declaration on Sanitation and Hygiene, and Agenda 2063 on ‘Africa We Want’. Currently, water, sanitation, and sewerage
                    coverage in the country stand at 60%, 93%, and 16% respectively which is still far from reaching universal access to water and sanitation. But with the commitment and assurance from the government, we are optimistic to achieve universal
                    coverage in every village in the Country by the year 2030 as envisioned in Vision 2030. This will be achieved through various interventions aligned with the National Water and Sanitation Strategy (NWSS), 2020-2025. </p>

                    The importance of water is well recognized in the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, and the Kenya Vision 2030. The constitution articulates that “every person has the right to clean and safe water in adequate quality and quantities”. In addition, the Kenya
                    Vision 2030 highlights that the overall goal of the Environment, Water and Sanitation sector is to attain a “clean, secure and sustainable environment” by 2030. The Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and Irrigation through the State Department
                    for Water and Sanitation has increased water coverage(distance of 2km reach) from 57% in 2019/20 to 60% in 2020/21, urban sewerage coverageincreased from 15% to 16% while overall sanitation coverage increased from 88% to 93% during
                    the same period.The increase in water coverage was achieved through the completion of multi-purpose dams and medium-sized dams; Karimenu, Yamo, Forole peace, Kases, Nakuetum, Ura 4 Earth, Kianjuri Earth, and Thangatha Concrete lined
                    earth dam; water schemes in major cities and expansion of water supplies in most of the medium size towns; sanitation projects in low urban income areas/informal settlements and rural marginalized/ASAL as well as completion of projects
                    implemented under the Kenya Towns Sustainable Water and Sanitation program targeting rehabilitation and expansion of water and sanitation infrastructure in 28 towns across the country, connecting 2.1 million people to clean water and
                    1.3 million to sewer systems. The state department of water and sanitation is committed to undertaking the water 10,000 programme action plan for short and long-term interventions with a total of 22,171 earmarked projects as follows:-
                    5,974 Water for Schools Projects, 7,294 Boreholes, 1,555 Water Pans, 868 Small Dams, 1,468 Roof catchments, 1,467 Desilting of pans/dams, 291 Spring protection, and distribution, 2,897 Water Supply/ pipeline extension, 240 Sand dams
                    and policy intervention., which is part of the Kenya Kwanza manifesto. The short-term interventions will include small and medium water supplies targeting all wards in the Country with a target of reaching 5,000,000 households. In
                    the long term, the programme will target water harvesting and storage by developing large-size dams distributed across the Country reaching 8,000,000 households.
